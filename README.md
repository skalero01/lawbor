## Legal Document Intelligence Platform

A specialized platform designed to optimize the handling, summarization, and secure sharing of legal documents for prosecutors' offices, law firms, legal agencies, and related institutions.

## 🚀 Purpose

Legal cases often involve thousands of pages of scanned, outdated, or manually written documents that are hard to navigate, share, or analyze. This platform aims to **simplify** that process through a combination of **digitization**, **anonymization**, and **AI-powered summarization**.

## 🧠 Core Features

1. **📄 Document Digitization**
   - Upload scanned or non-digital files.
   - Automatically convert images and PDFs into machine-readable text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

2. **🔒 Data Anonymization**
   - Automatically detects and replaces sensitive data:
     - Names of people involved
     - Locations
     - Courses or institutions
     - Any personally identifiable information (PII)

3. **🧾 Smart Summarization**
   - Uses AI to extract and highlight key information from each document.
   - Outputs a clean summary page with:
     - An overview of the case
     - Main events and actors (anonymized)
     - Contextual metadata

## ✅ Benefits

- Avoid reading full legal files to understand the core of a case.
- Save time and protect confidentiality.
- Prepare digital files ready for sharing, reviewing, and archiving.

## 🔭 Future Roadmap

- **Citizen Access Portal**: Enable individuals to view documents where they are involved, verified through CURP or other official ID.
- **Lawyer Case Dashboard**: Allow attorneys to access all documents for cases they are assigned to, while ensuring anonymized views of sensitive data.
- **Smart Distribution**: Share summarized legal content to relevant parties without compromising active investigations.
